/*
PROBLEM:
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?
Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right

Example 2:
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m==0||n==0)
            return 0;
        vector<vector<int>> paths(m,vector<int>(n,1));
        for(int i=1;i<m;i++)
        {
            for(int j=1;j<n;j++)
                paths[i][j]=paths[i-1][j]+paths[i][j-1];
        }
        return paths[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
